Math 7670: An introduction to toric varieties
Spring 2019
Cornell University
Mike Stillman

This is the git repo for my course on toric varieties.  It includes
homework (really, suggested problems), information sheets, handouts,
and lecture notes (being compiled during the semester, participants
are taking notes, tex'ing them, and we are making them available
here.)
